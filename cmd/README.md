# БЭСМ-6 Soviet Mainframe Simulator

No, this isn't simulating an actual real Soviet mainframe. Rather this project is more like a sort of toy or game to simulating something we pretend is a Soviet mainframe from the cold war which learners of Go programming can hack into.

The purpose here is to learn the following Go programming skills:

- How to work with input and output
- Launching external processes
- Socket based communication
- Asychronous programming with Go routines

We could have done this in any number of ways. The purpose is to learn while having some fun. What is more fun than pretending to be a hacker. Don't worry you are not really learning skills that can be used for real world hacking today.
